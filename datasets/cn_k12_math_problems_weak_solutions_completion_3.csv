$$
\begin{cases}

Solving this, we get $-1 < x < 1$, which means the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$.

2. Since the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$, which is symmetric about the origin, let $F(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. Then $F(-x) = f(-x) - g(-x) = \log_a(1-x) - \log_a(1+x) = -[\log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)] = -F(x)$. Therefore, $f(x) - g(x)$ is an odd function.

3. From $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, we get $f(x) > g(x)$, which means $\log_a(1+x) > \log_a(1-x)$. If $a > 1$, then

Solving this, we get $-1 < x < 0$. In summary, if $a > 1$, the solution set for the inequality is $(0, 1)$, and if $0 < a < 1$, the solution set for the inequality is $(-1, 0)$.

We want to find the values of $x$ for which both $f(x) = \log_a (1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a (1-x)$ are defined. 
For $f(x)$, we require $1+x > 0$, which gives us the domain $x > -1$. For $g(x)$, we need $1-x > 0$, giving us $x < 1$. Therefore, the overlap of their domains is $x \in (-1, 1)$.

Step 2: Next, we'll determine the parity of the function $f(x) - g(x)$. Parity refers to the behavior of the function around odd and even integers. Both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are even functions, because they are of the form $f(x) = h(-x)$ for some function $h$. 
So, $f(x) - g(x)$ is an even function minus an even function, which is an odd function. This means that $f(x) - g(x)$ changes sign around zero.

Step 3: Finally, we need to find the range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$. From the previous step, we know that the function changes from negative to positive as we move away from zero. 
Therefore, we only need to find the zero-crossing point. Setting $f(x) - g(x) = 0$, we get $\log_a(1+x) = \log_a(1-x)$. This simplifies to $1+x = 1-x$, which gives us $x = 0$. 

So, the required range is $x \in (-1, 0)$.

Therefore, the boxed answer is:
$$\boxed{x \in \left(-1, 0\right)}.$$","The candidate solution is incorrect in Step 2 and Step 3. In Step 2, the parity of the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is incorrectly identified as an even function. The correct approach is to consider the symmetry of the domain and analyze the function's behavior around the origin. By showing that $F(x) = -F(-x)$, it can be concluded that $f(x) - g(x)$ is an odd function.

In Step 3, the solution incorrectly assumes that finding the zero-crossing point is sufficient to determine the range where $f(x) - g(x) > 0$. However, the function's behavior depends on the value of $a$. For $a > 1$, the function is increasing on the interval $(-1, 1)$, so $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ for $x \in (0, 1)$. For $0 < a < 1$, the function is decreasing on the interval $(-1, 1)$, so $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ for $x \in (-1, 0)$. The candidate solution fails to consider these cases and provides an incomplete answer.","Step 1: Let's start with the domain. We want to find the values of $x$ for which both $f(x) = \log_a (1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a (1-x)$ are defined. 
For $f(x)$, we require $1+x > 0$, which gives us the domain $x > -1$. For $g(x)$, we need $1-x > 0$, giving us $x < 1$. Therefore, the overlap of their domains is $x \in (-1, 1)$.

So, $f(x) - g(x)$ is an even function minus an even function, which is an even function. This means that $f(x) - g(x)$ is symmetric about the y-axis.","Here is a step-by-step solution to the problem:

1. **Domain of $f(x) - g(x)$:**

The function $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ is defined for $1+x>0$, which gives $x>-1$. Similarly, $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$ is defined for $1-x>0$, resulting in $x<1$.

For $f(x) - g(x)$ to be defined, both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ must be defined. Therefore, the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is the intersection of these two intervals:

$$
\begin{align*}
-1 &< x < 1 \\
\boxed{-1 < x < 1} &
\end{align*}
$$

2. **Parity of $f(x) - g(x)$:**

A function is even if $f(-x) = f(x)$ and odd if $f(-x) = -f(x)$. Let's check for both conditions:

$$
\begin{align*}
f(-x) - g(-x) &= \log_a(1-x) - \log_a(1+x) \\
&= -\log_a(1+x) + \log_a(1-x) \\
&= -\left(\log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)\right) \\
&= -(f(x) - g(x))
\end{align*}
$$

So, $f(x) - g(x)$ satisfies the condition for an odd function.

3. **Range of $x$ for $f(x) - g(x) > 0$:**

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) - g(x) &= \log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x) > 0 \\
\log_a \left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right) &> 0
\end{align*}
$$

The argument of the logarithm must be positive, so $\frac{1+x}{1-x} > 0$. This inequality holds for $-1 < x < 1$, which is the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$.

Now, for the inequality to be true, we must have:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1+x}{1-x} &> 1 \\
1+x &> 1-x \\
2x &> 0 \\
x &> 0
\end{align*}
$$

So, for $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, the range of $x$ is $\boxed{0 < x < 1}$.

These are the solutions to the given problem.",False,"The candidate solution is mostly correct, but it misses a crucial detail in the third part. The solution correctly finds that $x > 0$ for $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, but it doesn't consider the constraint $-1 < x < 1$ from the domain. Combining these two conditions, the solution set for $x$ should be $0 < x < 1$, which is the correct range for $a > 1$. However, for $0 < a < 1$, the inequality $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ becomes $f(x) < g(x)$, and the argument of the logarithm should be less than 1. This leads to a different range for $x$, which is $-1 < x < 0$. The candidate solution does not address this case and directly concludes that the range is $0 < x < 1$ for all values of $a$.","
Step 3: Now, let's find the range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$. We have:

\[
\begin{align*}
f(x) - g(x) &> 0 \\
\log_a (1+x) - \log_a (1-x) &> 0 \\
\log_a \left(\frac{1+x}{1-x}\right) &> 0 \, .
\end{align*}
\]

For the logarithm to be positive, the argument must be greater than 1. So, we have:

\[
\frac{1+x}{1-x} > 1 \, .
\]

Solving this inequality for $x$, we get:

\[
\begin{align*}
1 + x &> 1 - x \\
2x &> 0 \\
x &> 0 \, .
\end{align*}
\]

So, the range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ is $x \in (0, 1)$.

**Final Answers:**

1. **Domain of $f(x) - g(x)$:** $x \in (-1, 1)$.
2. **Parity:** The function $f(x) - g(x)$ is **even**.
3. **Range of $x$ for $f(x) - g(x) > 0$:** $x \in \boxed{(0, 1)}$.",False,"Step 1: The candidate solution correctly identifies the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ as $x \in (-1, 1)$. This is because both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are defined for these values of $x$, ensuring the difference is also defined in this interval.

Step 2: The reasoning in this step is incorrect. The parity of a function refers to its behavior under reflection about the y-axis, not necessarily about odd and even integers. The candidate solution states that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are even functions, but this is not accurate. In fact, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are neither even nor odd functions, as they do not satisfy the respective definitions. The correct approach is to consider the function $F(x) = f(x) - g(x)$ and analyze its behavior under reflection about the origin, as shown in the reference solution. By showing that $F(-x) = -F(x)$, it is proven that $f(x) - g(x)$ is an odd function.

Step 3: The candidate solution's approach to finding the range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ is flawed. While it is correct that the logarithm is positive when its argument is greater than 1, the subsequent steps and conclusion are incorrect. The inequality $\frac{1+x}{1-x} > 1$ does not imply $x > 0$. In fact, this inequality is equivalent to $1+x > 1-x$, which simplifies to $x > -x$, a condition that is always true for any real number $x$. Therefore, the candidate solution's conclusion that $x \in (0, 1)$ is not valid. The correct approach, as shown in the reference solution, is to consider the cases $a > 1$ and $0 < a < 1$ separately and analyze the corresponding inequalities."

where $\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}$ denotes the dot product of $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$.

Let's define the vectors:

- $\vec{OQ} = \langle x, y \rangle$

Then, $\vec{OP} + \vec{OQ} = \langle 2x-2, 2y-2 \rangle$.

This happens when $x + y = 1$ (from the line equation) and $x + y = 2$ (from the circle equation), which gives us the point $P = (1, 0)$ on the circle and $Q = (0, 1)$ on the line.

At these points, $|\vec{OP} + \vec{OQ}| = |\langle 1, 0 \rangle + \langle 0, 1 \rangle| = \sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{2}$.

However, there are several issues with the calculations and the overall reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Vector Definitions:** The vectors $\vec{OP}$ and $\vec{OQ}$ are incorrectly defined. $\vec{OP}$ should be the vector from the origin to point $P$ on the circle, and $\vec{OQ}$ should be the vector from the origin to point $Q$ on the line. The correct definitions should be:
   - $\vec{OP} = \langle x, y \rangle$ (not $\langle x-2, y-2 \rangle$)
   - $\vec{OQ} = \langle a, 1-a \rangle$ (not $\langle x, y \rangle$)

2. **Incorrect Application of Cauchy-Schwarz:** When applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, the dot product of $\vec{OP}$ and $\vec{OQ}$ is calculated incorrectly. The correct dot product should be:
   $$\vec{OP} \cdot \vec{OQ} = \langle x, y \rangle \cdot \langle a, 1-a \rangle = xa + y(1-a)$$
   This is different from the candidate solution's calculation.

3. **Incorrect Simplification:** The simplification steps in the candidate solution are incorrect and lead to an invalid inequality. The correct simplification should involve squaring the dot product and expanding the squares, but the candidate solution's approach introduces errors.

4. **Incorrect Conclusion:** The candidate solution concludes that the minimum value of $|\vec{OP} + \vec{OQ}|$ occurs when $\vec{OP}$ and $\vec{OQ}$ are parallel, which is not necessarily true. The minimum value occurs when the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality becomes an equality, but this does not always imply parallelism. The correct approach should involve finding the conditions for equality in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and then solving for the coordinates of points $P$ and $Q$.","
Step 4: The area of $\triangle ABC$ is given by $[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin C$. Using the identity $\sin C = 2\sin \frac{C}{2} \cos \frac{C}{2}$, we get 

$$[\triangle ABC] = ab \sin \frac{C}{2} \cos \frac{C}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}ab.$$ 

Step 5: To maximize the area, we need to maximize $ab$. From step 3, we know that $ab \leq \frac{9}{4}$. So, the maximum value of $ab$ is $\boxed{\frac{9}{4}}$, and the maximum area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\boxed{\frac{3\sqrt{5}}{4}}$.",False,"The candidate solution starts off correctly by deriving the value of $\cos C$ in Step 1 and applying the cosine law in Step 2 to find the value of $c$. However, in Step 3, there is an error in simplifying the inequality. The correct inequality should be $a^2 + b^2 - \frac{8}{9}ab \geq 0$, which leads to $ab \leq \frac{9}{8}$, not $\frac{9}{4}$. This is because the term $-2ab \cos C$ in the original inequality becomes $-\frac{8}{9}ab$ when substituting $\cos C = \frac{1}{9}$, not $-4ab \frac{1}{9}$.

Step 4 also contains an error in calculating the area. The area of a triangle with sides $a, b$, and $c$ is given by the formula $S = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin C$, where $\sin C$ is calculated using the sine law. The candidate solution incorrectly applies the identity $\sin C = 2\sin \frac{C}{2} \cos \frac{C}{2}$ directly to the area formula, which is not valid in this context. The correct approach is to use the sine law to find $\sin C$ in terms of the given information.

Finally, Step 5 concludes that the maximum area is $\frac{3\sqrt{5}}{4}$, which is incorrect due to the errors in the previous steps. The correct maximum area should be $\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}$, as shown in the ground-truth solution."

Let the coordinates of $P$ be $(x,y)$, then $P$ is any point on the circle $C$: $(x-2)^{2}+(y-2)^{2}=1$.

Let the coordinates of $Q$ be $(a,1-a)$, then $Q$ is any point on the line $l$: $x+y=1$.

Thus, $\overrightarrow{OP}+ \overrightarrow{OQ}=(x+a,y+1-a)$, and $| \overrightarrow{OP}+ \overrightarrow{OQ}|= \sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+(y+1-a)^{2}}$, which represents the distance from the point $(-a,a-1)$ to any point on the circle $C$: $(x-2)^{2}+(y-2)^{2}=1$.

Let the distance between the point $(-a,a-1)$ and the center of the circle $C(2,2)$ be $d$, then the minimum value of $| \overrightarrow{OP}+ \overrightarrow{OQ}|$ is $d-1$.

We have $d= \sqrt{(-a-2)^{2}+(a-1-2)^{2}}= \sqrt{2a^{2}-2a+13}= \sqrt{2(a- \frac{1}{2})^{2}+ \frac{25}{2}}$,

When $a= \frac{1}{2}$, $d$ is minimum and equals to $ \sqrt{ \frac{25}{2}}$, hence the minimum value of $| \overrightarrow{OP}+ \overrightarrow{OQ}|$ is $d-1= \frac{5 \sqrt{2}}{2}-1= \boxed{\frac{5 \sqrt{2}-2}{2}}$.

Firstly, determine that the line $l$: $x+y=1$ and the circle $C$ are separate. Then, set the coordinates of $P$ and $Q$ to obtain the coordinates of $\overrightarrow{OP}+ \overrightarrow{OQ}$. The analytical expression of $| \overrightarrow{OP}+ \overrightarrow{OQ}|$ can be derived, and its minimum value can be found using the geometric meaning of $| \overrightarrow{OP}+ \overrightarrow{OQ}|$ and the properties of quadratic functions.

$$
\begin{equation*}
    \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin C \,.
\end{equation*}
$$

We are given that $a \cos B + b \cos A = 2$. We can square this equation to get:

$$
\begin{align*}
    (a \cos B + b \cos A)^2 & = 2^2 \\
    a^2 \cos^2 B + 2ab \cos A \cos B + b^2 \cos^2 A & = 4 \\
    a^2 \left( \frac{1 + \cos C}{2} \right) + 2ab \cos A \cos B + b^2 \left( \frac{1 + \cos C}{2} \right) & = 4 \\
    \frac{a^2 + 2ab \cos A \cos B + b^2}{2} + \frac{a^2 \cos C + 2ab \cos A \cos B + b^2 \cos C}{2} & = 4 \\
    \frac{(a + b \cos A)^2}{2} + \frac{(a \cos C + b \cos B)^2}{2} & = 4 \, .
\end{align*}
$$

Now, we can use the double-angle formula for cosine:

$$
\begin{align*}
    \cos C & = 2 \cos^2 \frac{C}{2} - 1 \\
    & = 2 \left( \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3} \right)^2 - 1 \\
    & = \frac{5}{3} \, .
\end{align*}
$$

Substituting this value back into the equation above, we get:

$$
\begin{align*}
    \frac{(a + b \cos A)^2}{2} + \frac{(a \cdot \frac{5}{3} + b \cos B)^2}{2} & = 4 \\
    3(a + b \cos A)^2 + 9(a \cdot \frac{5}{3} + b \cos B)^2 & = 72 \\
    3(a^2 + 2ab \cos A + b^2 \cos^2 A) + 9(a^2 \cdot \frac{25}{9} + 2ab \cdot \frac{5}{3} \cos B + b^2 \cos^2 B) & = 72 \\
    3a^2 + 6ab \cos A + 3b^2 \cos^2 A + 10a^2 + 20ab \cos B + 9b^2 \cos^2 B & = 72 \, .
\end{align*}
$$

Now, we can use the given equation $a \cos B + b \cos A = 2$ to eliminate $\cos A$ and $\cos B$:

$$
\begin{align*}
    3a^2 + 6ab \cdot \frac{2 - b \cos B}{a} + 3b^2 \left( \frac{2 - a \cos B}{b} \right)^2 + 10a^2 + 20ab \cos B + 9b^2 \cos^2 B & = 72 \\
    3a^2 + 12ab - 6b^2 \cos B + 3b^2 \left( 4 - 4a \cos B + a^2 \cos^2 B \right) + 10a^2 + 20ab \cos B + 9b^2 \cos^2 B & = 72 \\
    13a^2 + 12ab - 6b^2 \cos B + 12b^2 - 12ab \cos B + 3a^2 \cos^2 B + 10a^2 + 20ab \cos B + 9b^2 \cos^2 B & = 72 \\
    23a^2 + 12ab + 22b^2 - 18b^2 \cos B + 3a^2 \cos^2 B + 20ab \cos B + 9b^2 \cos^2 B & = 72 \, .
\end{align*}
$$

Now, we can use the identity $\cos^2 B = 1 - \sin^2 B$ to simplify:

$$
\begin{align*}
    23a^2 + 12ab + 22b^2 - 18b^2 \cos B + 3a^2 (1 - \sin^2 B) + 20ab \cos B + 9b^2 (1 - \sin^2 B) & = 72 \\
    26a^2 + 12ab + 31b^2 - 18b^2 \cos B - 3a^2 \sin^2 B - 20ab \sin^2 B - 9b^2 \sin^2 B & = 72 \, .
\end{align*}
$$

Now, we can use the identity $\sin^2 B = 1 - \cos^2 B$ to simplify further:

$$
\begin{align*}
    26a^2 + 12ab + 31b^2 - 18b^2 \cos B - 3a^2 (1 - \cos^2 B) - 20ab (1 - \cos^2 B) - 9b^2 (1 - \cos^2 B) & = 72 \\
    26a^2 + 12ab + 31b^2 - 18b^2 \cos B - 3a^2 + 3a^2 \cos^2 B + 20ab - 20ab \cos^2 B - 9b^2 + 9b^2 \cos^2 B & = 72 \\
    23a^2 + 12ab + 22b^2 - 18b^2 \cos B + 3a^2 \cos^2 B + 20ab - 20ab \cos^2 B - 9b^2 + 9b^2 \cos^2 B & = 72 \, .
\end{align*}
$$

This equation is already satisfied, as it is identical to the equation we derived earlier. Now, we can find the maximum value of $\sin C$ to determine the maximum area of the triangle. We have:

$$
\begin{align*}
    \sin C & = 2 \sin \frac{C}{2} \cos \frac{C}{2} \\
    & = 2 \sin \frac{C}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3} \, .
\end{align*}
$$

The maximum value of $\sin \frac{C}{2}$ is $1$, so the maximum value of $\sin C$ is $\boxed{\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{3}}$.

Therefore, the maximum area of $\triangle ABC$ is $\frac{1}{2}ab \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}ab$.",False,"The candidate solution starts by correctly stating the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of two sides and the included angle. However, the subsequent steps and calculations contain several errors and inconsistencies.

The candidate solution squares the equation $a \cos B + b \cos A = 2$ and then tries to manipulate the terms to simplify and solve for $a, b,$ and $c$. However, the manipulations and substitutions are incorrect and lead to an inconsistent equation. For instance, the step where they substitute $\cos C = \frac{5}{3}$ and then proceed to expand and simplify is flawed. The expansion and simplification should yield a different result, and the subsequent steps do not lead to a valid equation.

Furthermore, the candidate solution does not correctly apply the double-angle formula for cosine. The correct formula is $\cos C = 2\cos^2 \frac{C}{2} - 1$, but they seem to have used a different formula, leading to an incorrect value for $\cos C$. This error propagates through the rest of the solution.

The candidate solution also incorrectly states that the equation they derived is already satisfied. This is not the case, as the equation they derived is not equivalent to the original equation. The manipulations and substitutions have altered the equation, and it no longer represents the given conditions.

Finally, the candidate solution calculates the maximum value of $\sin C$ as $\frac{2\sqrt{5}}{3}$, but this is incorrect. The maximum value of $\sin C$ should be determined using the given conditions and the properties of the triangle. The correct approach would be to use the given value of $\cos \frac{C}{2}$ and the properties of the triangle to find the maximum value of $\sin C$, which would then lead to the maximum area of the triangle.","
Step 3: Squaring both sides and simplifying, we get
$$|\vec{OP} + \vec{OQ}|^2 = (1+r\cos\theta)^2 + (2+r\sin\theta)^2 + (2-2s)^2.$$

Step 4: Expanding and collecting terms,
$$|\vec{OP} + \vec{OQ}|^2 = 10 + 4r\cos\theta + 4r\sin\theta.$$

Step 5: Using the identity $\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta = 1$, we can write
$$|\vec{OP} + \vec{OQ}|^2 = 14 + 4r\cos\theta + 4r\sin\theta - 4r^2.$$

Step 6: Since $r=1$, we have
$$|\vec{OP} + \vec{OQ}|^2 = 10 + 4\cos\theta + 4\sin\theta.$$

Step 7: Using the identity $\cos\theta = \frac{1-\tan^2\theta/2}{1+\tan^2\theta/2}$ and $\sin\theta = \frac{2\tan\theta/2}{1+\tan^2\theta/2}$, we can write
$$|\vec{OP} + \vec{OQ}|^2 = 10 + \frac{4(1-\tan^2\theta/2)}{1+\tan^2\theta/2} + \frac{8\tan\theta/2}{1+\tan^2\theta/2}.$$

Step 8: Simplifying, we get
$$|\vec{OP} + \vec{OQ}|^2 = 12 + \frac{16\tan\theta/2}{1+\tan^2\theta/2}.$$

Step 9: The minimum value of the right-hand side occurs when $\tan\theta/2 = 0$, which gives $\theta = 0$.

Step 10: Hence, the minimum value of $|\vec{OP} + \vec{OQ}|$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{12}}$.",False,"The candidate solution attempts to find the minimum value of $|\vec{OP} + \vec{OQ}|$ by parameterizing the points $P$ and $Q$ on the circle and line, respectively, and then manipulating the resulting expression. However, there are several issues with this approach:

- Step 1: While parameterizing the points is a valid strategy, the candidate solution does not correctly represent the points on the circle and line. The point on the circle should be $(2 + \cos\theta, 2 + \sin\theta)$, not $(2 + r\cos\theta, 2 + r\sin\theta)$, as $r$ is already the radius and should not be multiplied by the trigonometric functions. Similarly, the point on the line should be $(1-s, s)$, not $(1-s, 1+s)$.

- Step 2: The expression for $|\vec{OP} + \vec{OQ}|$ is incorrect. It should be the sum of the distances from the origin to $P$ and $Q$, not the sum of the squares of these distances. The correct expression is $|\vec{OP} + \vec{OQ}| = \sqrt{(2 + \cos\theta - 1)^2 + (2 + \sin\theta - s)^2}$.

- Step 3: Squaring both sides of the equation in Step 2 is not necessary and leads to a more complicated expression. The candidate solution should have directly manipulated the expression from Step 2.

- Step 4 and onwards: Due to the initial mistakes, the subsequent steps involve incorrect manipulations and simplifications, leading to an incorrect final answer."
