15,"Given the sequence ${a_n}$, the sum of the first n terms, S<sub>n</sub>, is equal to $n^2$. Find the value of $a_3^2 - a_2^2$.
A: 9

$$a_2 = S_2 - S_1 = 4 - 1 = 3$$
$$a_3 = S_3 - S_2 = 9 - 4 = 5$$

$$a_3^2 - a_2^2 = (5)^2 - (3)^2 = 25 - 9 = \boxed{16}$$

Thus, the correct answer is $\boxed{B}$.",[],[],"Step 1: We have $S_n = n^2$ for all $n$. Setting $n = 3$, we get $S_3 = 9$. Thus, $a_3 = 3$.

Step 3: We can now compute $a_3^2 - a_2^2 = 9 - 4 = **\boxed{5}**$.","The candidate solution is incorrect. In Step 1, it incorrectly assumes that $a_3 = 3$ when $S_3 = 9$. This is because $a_3$ is the difference between $S_3$ and $S_2$, not the value of $S_3$ itself. This mistake leads to an incorrect value for $a_3$ and subsequently for $a_2$ in Step 2. As a result, the calculation in Step 3 is also incorrect.","Step 1: We have $S_n = n^2$ for all $n$. Setting $n = 3$, we get $S_3 = 9$. Thus, $a_3 = 3$.

Step 2: Setting $n = 2$, we get $S_2 = 4$. Hence, $a_2 = 2$.","We are given that $S_n = n^2$.

So, for the first three terms, we have:

$$
\begin{equation*}
S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 3^2 = 9 \, .
\end{equation*}
$$

For the first two terms, we have:

$$
\begin{equation*}
S_2 = a_1 + a_2 = 2^2 = 4 \, .

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives:

$$
\begin{align*}
S_3 - S_2 & = (a_1 + a_2 + a_3) - (a_1 + a_2) \\
9 - 4 & = a_3 \\
5 & = a_3 \, .

$$

So, $a_3 = 5$ and $a_2 = 4 - a_1$.

Now, we can calculate the value of $a_3^2 - a_2^2$:

$$
\begin{align*}
a_3^2 - a_2^2 & = 5^2 - (4 - a_1)^2 \\
& = 25 - (16 - 8a_1 + a_1^2) \\
& = 25 - 16 + 8a_1 - a_1^2 \\
& = 9 + 8a_1 - a_1^2 \, .

$$

Since we don't have the value of $a_1$, we cannot simplify further. However, we can see that the expression $9 + 8a_1 - a_1^2$ is a quadratic in $a_1$. This means that the correct answer should be a number that can be expressed as a sum of squares, as that is the only way to get a difference of squares in the original expression.

The only option that satisfies this condition is $\boxed{D: 11}$, as $11 = 3^2 - 2^2$."
16,"In acute triangle $\triangle ABC$, the sides opposite to angles $A$, $B$, and $C$ are $a$, $b$, and $c$, respectively. If $a=4$, $b=5$, and the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $5 \sqrt {3}$, find $|AB|$.","Given: $a=4$, $b=5$, and the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $5 \sqrt {3}$.

We know that the area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula $\frac{1}{2}ab\sin C$. So,
$$
\frac{1}{2}ab\sin C=5 \sqrt {3} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{2}\times 4 \times 5 \times \sin C=5 \sqrt {3} \Rightarrow \sin C=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
$$
Since $\triangle ABC$ is an acute triangle and $\sin C=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, we can deduce that angle $C$ is $\frac{\pi}{3}$. Now, using the cosine law, we can find $c$ (which represents $|AB|$):
$$
c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\cos C = 16+25-2\times 4 \times 5 \times \frac{1}{2}=21.
$$
Hence, $c = \sqrt{21}$ and $|AB| = \boxed{\sqrt{21}}$.

To solve this problem, we first used the formula for the area of a triangle to find the sine of angle $C$. Then, using the information that the triangle is acute and the value of $\sin C$, we determined that angle $C$ is $\frac{\pi}{3}$. Finally, we applied the cosine law to find the length of side $c$, which represents $|AB|$. This problem tests understanding of the cosine law and the application of the triangle area formula in solving triangles, requiring both computational skills and problem-solving ability.",[],[],"Given the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $5\sqrt{3}$, we can find the height corresponding to side $a$, which equals $2\sqrt{3}$. 

Using this height in the formula for the area of a triangle, we can find that the half of the base corresponding to this height is equal to $5/2$. 

Therefore, we have that $AB+BC=5$. 
Since $AB+BC+AC=a+b+c=9$, we get that $AC=4$. 

Using the cosine formula, we can compute $\cos A$ and $\cos B$:
\begin{align*}
\cos A &= \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} = \frac{25+9-16}{10\cdot 4} = \frac{18}{40} \\
\cos B &= \frac{c^2 + a^2 - b^2}{2ac} = \frac{9+16-25}{10\cdot 4} = \frac{1}{20}
\end{align*}

Now, let's use the angle addition formula to find $\cos 2A$:
$\cos 2A = \cos A \cdot \cos C + \sin A \cdot \sin C = \frac{18}{40} \cdot \cos C + \frac{6}{40} \cdot \sin C$. 

We also know that $\cos 2A = 2\cos^2 A - 1$, so we have:
$2\cos^2 A - 1 = \frac{18}{40} \cdot \cos C + \frac{6}{40} \cdot \sin C$. 

For $\cos C$, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles is $\pi$, and so $A+B+C= \pi$. Then $C = \pi - A - B$. Also, we know that $0^\circ \leq C \leq 90^\circ$, so $\cos C \geq 0$. This gives us:
$2\left(\frac{18}{40}\right)^2 - 1 = \frac{9}{400} - 1 \leq \frac{18}{40} \cdot \cos C \leq \frac{9}{400} + \frac{1}{20}$. 

Solving this inequality gives us $\frac{1}{20} \leq \cos C \leq \frac{11}{40}$. 

Combining this with what we know about $\cos 2A$, we get:
$\frac{19}{400} \leq \cos 2A \leq \frac{121}{400}$. 

The largest value of $\cos 2A$ would correspond to the smallest possible value of $AB$, so let's assume that $\cos 2A = \frac{121}{400}$. 

We can now find $AB$:
$AB = \frac{1}{\sin 2A} = \boxed{\frac{20\sqrt{5}}{11\sqrt{3}}}$.","The candidate solution is incorrect. The approach taken is to find the height corresponding to side $a$ and then use it to determine the length of $AB$. However, the calculation of the height is inaccurate. The correct height corresponding to side $a$ is $\sqrt{3}$, not $2\sqrt{3}$. This initial mistake propagates through the subsequent steps, leading to incorrect values for the base and, consequently, the length of $AB$.","Step 1: Given the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $5\sqrt{3}$, we can find the height corresponding to side $a$, which equals $2\sqrt{3}$. 

Step 2: Using this height in the formula for the area of a triangle, we can find that the half of the base corresponding to this height is equal to $5/2$. 

Step 3: Therefore, we have that $AB+BC=5$.","We can use the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its sides and the in-radius, which is given by:

$$
\begin{equation*}
    \text{Area} = rs\,,
\end{equation*}
$$

where $r$ is the in-radius and $s$ is the semi-perimeter.

The semi-perimeter, $s$, is given by:

$$
\begin{equation*}
    s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}\,.
\end{equation*}
$$

We know that $a = 4$ and $b = 5$. To find $c$, we can use the fact that $AB$, the side we're looking for, is the hypotenuse of a $30^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ$ triangle with sides $4$ and $5$. Therefore, $c = 2\cdot 4 = \boxed{8}$.

Now, we can calculate the semi-perimeter:

$$
\begin{align*}
    s & = \frac{4+5+8}{2} \\
    & = \frac{17}{2}\,.
\end{align*}
$$

Substituting the values of the area and semi-perimeter into the area formula, we get:

$$
\begin{align*}
    5\sqrt{3} & = r\left(\frac{17}{2}\right) \\
    \frac{10\sqrt{3}}{17} & = r\,.
\end{align*}
$$

Now, we can use Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle:

$$
\begin{align*}
    \text{Area} & = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \\
    & = \sqrt{\left(\frac{17}{2}\right)\left(\frac{17}{2}-4\right)\left(\frac{17}{2}-5\right)\left(\frac{17}{2}-8\right)} \\
    & = \sqrt{\left(\frac{17}{2}\right)\left(\frac{9}{2}\right)\left(\frac{7}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)} \\
    & = \sqrt{\frac{5355}{8}} \\
    & = \frac{\sqrt{5355}}{2\sqrt{2}}\,.
\end{align*}
$$

Equating this to $5\sqrt{3}$, we get:

$$
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\sqrt{5355}}{2\sqrt{2}} & = 5\sqrt{3} \\
    \sqrt{5355} & = 20\sqrt{6} \\
    5355 & = 2400 \\
    5355 - 2400 & = 0 \\
    2955 & = 0\,.
\end{align*}
$$

This is a contradiction, so no such triangle exists.

Therefore, the length of $AB$ cannot be determined from the given information."

$$2i = -z\sqrt{3} - zi$$

Now, we can equate the real and imaginary parts of the complex number on the right-hand side to the real and imaginary parts on the left-hand side.

The imaginary part on the left-hand side is $2$, so we have:

$$2 = -z\sqrt{3}$$

Dividing both sides by $-\sqrt{3}$ gives:

$$z = \frac{2}{-\sqrt{3}}$$

$$z = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$$

We can rationalize the denominator by multiplying the top and bottom by $\sqrt{3}$:

$$z = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}$$

$$z = -\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$$

Now, we can write this in the form $a + bi$ to compare it to the options provided:

$$z = -\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} = -\frac{2}{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} = -\frac{2}{3} \cdot (\sqrt{3} \cdot 1) = -\frac{2}{3} \cdot (1 \cdot \sqrt{3}) = -\frac{2}{3} \cdot (1 + i\sqrt{3})$$

Now, we can compare this to the given options:

- Option C: $-\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$ has $a = -\frac{1}{2}$ and $b = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, which doesn't match our calculated values.
- Option D: $-\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$ has $a = -\frac{1}{2}$ and $b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, which also doesn't match.

So, the values are $B=\boxed{60^{\circ}}$, $C=\boxed{90^{\circ}}$, and $a=\boxed{\sqrt{3}}$.",[],[],"In $\triangle ABC$, we are told that $b = 3$ and $c = 2\sqrt{3}$. We're also given the angle $A = 30^{\circ}$. 

We can use the trigonometric identities to find the other angles and the side $a$. 

Sin of $A$: $\sin(30^{\circ}) = \frac{a}{c} \implies a = \frac{c \sin(30^{\circ})}{\sin(A)} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \cdot 0.5}{\sin(A)}$

Cos of $A$: $\cos(30^{\circ}) = \frac{b}{c} \implies \sin(B) = \frac{c \cos(30^{\circ})}{b} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \cdot 0.866}{3} = \sqrt{3} \cdot 0.286$

The angles in the triangle are: $\boxed{30^{\circ}, 116.4^{\circ}, 63.6^{\circ}}$.","The candidate solution starts by correctly identifying the given values and the goal of finding the other angles and side $a$. However, it then proceeds to use trigonometric identities incorrectly. 

The first issue arises when calculating the sine of angle $A$. The candidate solution states that $\sin(30^{\circ}) = \frac{a}{c}$, which is not a standard trigonometric identity. The correct approach would be to use the definition of sine in a right-angled triangle, which relates the side opposite an angle to the hypotenuse. In this case, since angle $A$ is $30^{\circ}$, the correct identity to use is $\sin(A) = \frac{a}{c}$, not $\sin(30^{\circ}) = \frac{a}{c}$. 

The next mistake occurs when calculating the cosine of angle $A$. The candidate solution states that $\cos(30^{\circ}) = \frac{b}{c}$, which is incorrect for the same reason as above. The correct identity to use here is $\cos(A) = \frac{b}{c}$. 

These incorrect identities lead to wrong values for $a$ and $\sin(B)$, which subsequently affect the calculations of angles $B$ and $C$. The candidate solution then uses the sum of angles in a triangle to find $B$ and $C$, but the incorrect values for $\sin(B)$ and $a$ lead to an inaccurate result. 

The final answer for side $a$ and the angles are incorrect due to the initial mistakes in applying trigonometric identities.","Step 1: In $\triangle ABC$, we are told that $b = 3$ and $c = 2\sqrt{3}$. We're also given the angle $A = 30^{\circ}$. 

Step 2: We can use the trigonometric identities to find the other angles and the side $a$. 

Step 3: Sin of $A$: $\sin(30^{\circ}) = \frac{a}{c} \implies a = \frac{c \sin(30^{\circ})}{\sin(A)} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \cdot 0.5}{\sin(A)}$","We are given the following information:

$$C = 180^\circ - 30^\circ - B = 150^\circ - B$$

Next, we can use the fact that $\sin C = \frac{a}{2}$. From the given values, we can calculate:

$$\sin C = \frac{a}{2} = \frac{b}{c} = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

Multiplying by $3\sqrt{3}$ and simplifying:

$$\sqrt{3} \sin B = 3 \sin (150^\circ - B)$$

Using the identity $\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x$, we get:

$$\sqrt{3} \sin B = 3 \sin B$$

Dividing by $\sin B$ (assuming $B \neq 0^\circ$), we find:

$$\sqrt{3} = 3$$

This is not true, so our assumption that $B \neq 0^\circ$ is incorrect. Therefore, $B = 0^\circ$, and:

$$B = 180^\circ - A - C = 180^\circ - 30^\circ - 150^\circ = \boxed{0^\circ}$$

22,"Given ellipse $C_{1}: \dfrac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ \dfrac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1(a > b > 0)$ and hyperbola $C_{2}: x^{2}-y^{2}=4$ have the same right focus $F_{2}$. Point $P$ is a common point of $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$. If $|PF_{2}|=2$, then the eccentricity of the ellipse $C_{1}$ equals \_\_\_\_\_\_.","Given the problem, we can assume without loss of generality that point $P$ is in the first quadrant. The equation of the hyperbola $C_{2}: x^{2}-y^{2}=4$ can be rewritten as $\dfrac {x^{2}}{4}- \dfrac {y^{2}}{4}=1$.

Since $|PF_{1}|-|PF_{2}|=4$, we have $|PF_{1}|=6$. Therefore, $c= \sqrt {4+4}=2 \sqrt {2}$, which means $c=2 \sqrt {2}$.

By the definition of an ellipse, we have $2a=|PF_{2}|+|PF_{2}|=8$,

Thus, $a=4$.

Since the ellipse $C_{1}: \dfrac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ \dfrac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1(a > b > 0)$ and the hyperbola $C_{2}: x^{2}-y^{2}=4$ have the same right focus $F_{2}$,

The eccentricity of the ellipse $C_{1}$ is $e= \dfrac {c}{a}= \dfrac { \sqrt {2}}{2}$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\dfrac { \sqrt {2}}{2}}$.

By converting the equation of the hyperbola into its standard form and knowing $|PF_{2}|=2$ and $|PF_{1}|=6$, we can determine $a=4$ and $c=2 \sqrt {2}$, which allows us to find the eccentricity of the ellipse $C_{1}$.

This problem tests the geometric properties of ellipses and hyperbolas. The key to solving it is the correct application of the definition of eccentricity, making it a basic question.",[],[],"Step 1: The eccentricity of an ellipse is given by the formula $e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{b^2}{a^2}}$. 

Step 2: We are given that the ellipse and hyperbola share a right focus, and that $|PF_2| = 2$. Let's denote the distance of the foci from the center of the ellipse by $2c$. We thus have $2c + 2 = 2$, which implies $c = 1$. 

Step 3: The equation of the ellipse can then be written as $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{c^2} = 1$. Comparing with the standard equation of an ellipse, we find that $b = c$. 

Step 4: Substituting the value of $b$ and $c$ in the formula for eccentricity, we get $e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{b^2}{a^2}} = \boxed{\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{a^2}}}$.","The candidate solution is incorrect. In Step 2, it is stated that $2c + 2 = 2$, which is not a valid equation. The distance from the focus to the center of the ellipse is not equal to 2, as it is not given in the problem statement. This incorrect assumption leads to an inaccurate value for $c$.

Furthermore, in Step 3, the equation of the ellipse is written with $c^2$ in the denominator, which is not consistent with the standard form of an ellipse equation. The correct equation should be $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, as mentioned in the ground-truth solution.

These errors in the candidate solution's logic result in an incorrect final answer.","Step 1: The eccentricity of an ellipse is given by the formula $e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{b^2}{a^2}}$. 

Step 2: We are given that the ellipse and hyperbola share a right focus, and that $|PF_2| = 2$. Let's denote the distance of the foci from the center of the ellipse by $2c$. We thus have $2c + 2 = 2$, which implies $c = 1$.","Let's tackle this problem systematically:

1. **Understanding the Given Information:**
   - We have an ellipse $C_1$ and a hyperbola $C_2$ that share a right focus, $F_2$. This is a unique situation where these two conic sections have a special relationship.
   - The equation of $C_1$ is given as $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$, with $a > b > 0$. This represents an ellipse centered at the origin.
   - The equation of $C_2$ is $x^2 - y^2 = 4$, which is a hyperbola also centered at the origin.
   - Point $P$ lies on both $C_1$ and $C_2$, and the distance from $P$ to the focus $F_2$ is $|PF_2| = 2$.

2. **Finding the Eccentricity of the Ellipse:**
   - The eccentricity ($e$) of an ellipse is a measure of how elongated it is. It is defined as $e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{b^2}{a^2}}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively.
   - In this problem, we need to find the value of $a$ and $b$ to determine the eccentricity.

3. **Using the Focus of the Hyperbola:**
   - The hyperbola $C_2$ has the equation $x^2 - y^2 = 4$. The standard form of a hyperbola with foci on the $x$-axis is $(\frac{x-h}{a})^2 - (\frac{y-k}{b})^2 = 1$, where $(h, k)$ is the center, and $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively.
   - Comparing the given equation with the standard form, we can see that the center is at the origin $(0, 0)$, and the length of the semi-major axis (along the $x$-axis) is $a = 2$.
   - Since $F_2$ is the right focus, it is located at $(2, 0)$.

4. **Finding the Distance from $P$ to $F_2$:**
   - Let's find the coordinates of point $P$. Since $P$ lies on both $C_1$ and $C_2$, it must satisfy both equations.
   - For $C_2$, we can substitute $y = 0$ (as $F_2$ is on the $x$-axis) to find $x$:
     $x^2 - 0^2 = 4$
     $x^2 = 4$
     $x = \pm 2$.
   - So, the possible coordinates of $P$ are $(2, 0)$ or $(-2, 0)$. Since $|PF_2| = 2$, $P$ must be $(-2, 0)$, as the distance from $(-2, 0)$ to $(2, 0)$ is indeed $2$.

5. **Determining the Eccentricity of $C_1$:**
   - Now, we can use the distance from $P$ to $F_2$ to find the value of $a$ for the ellipse $C_1$.
   - In an ellipse, the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant and equal to $2a$.
   - Let $F_1$ be the left focus of $C_1$. Then, $|PF_1| + |PF_2| = 2a$.
   - We know $|PF_2| = 2$, and since $F_1$ is the left focus, it is the mirror image of $F_2$ across the $y-axis$, so $|PF_1| = 2$ as well.
   - Thus, $2 + 2 = 2a$, which gives us $a = 2$.
   - Now, we can find the eccentricity:
     $e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{b^2}{a^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{b^2}{4}}$.

6. **Final Answer:**
   - Without the value of $b$, we cannot provide a numerical value for the eccentricity. However, we can express the eccentricity in terms of $b$:
   \[\boxed{e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{b^2}{4}}}\].

The eccentricity of the ellipse $C_1$ is indeed dependent on the value of $b$, and without further information, we cannot provide a specific numerical value."

Step 3: Therefore, we have $a_{99} = 9$ and $a_{100} = 4$.","Here is a step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Understanding the pattern**

The sequence $a_n$ seems to be a combination of two alternating sequences: one starting at 1 and counting up, and the other starting at 1 and counting down. The denominators of the sequence follow the same pattern, but they are shifted by one, starting at 1 and counting up.

**Step 2: Identifying the terms $a_{99}$ and $a_{100}$**

For $a_{99}$ and $a_{100}$, the numerator will be 1, and the denominator will be 99 and 100, respectively, based on the pattern.

So, $a_{99} = \frac{1}{99}$ and $a_{100} = \frac{1}{100}$.

**Step 3: Calculating the sum**

Now, we simply add the two fractions:

\[a_{99} + a_{100} = \frac{1}{99} + \frac{1}{100} = \frac{100 + 99}{9900} = \boxed{\frac{199}{9900}}.\]

So, the final answer is $\frac{199}{9900}$."
