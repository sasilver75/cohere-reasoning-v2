1. Find the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$.
2. Determine the parity of the function $f(x) - g(x)$.
3. Find the range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$.","1. Since $f(x) = \log_a(1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$, we have $f(x) - g(x) = \log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)$, where $a>0$ and $a \neq 1$. To ensure the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is meaningful, we need
$$
\begin{cases}
1+x > 0 \\
1-x > 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this, we get $-1 < x < 1$, which means the domain of the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$.

2. Since the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $(-1, 1)$, which is symmetric about the origin, let $F(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. Then $F(-x) = f(-x) - g(-x) = \log_a(1-x) - \log_a(1+x) = -[\log_a(1+x) - \log_a(1-x)] = -F(x)$. Therefore, $f(x) - g(x)$ is an odd function.

3. From $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, we get $f(x) > g(x)$, which means $\log_a(1+x) > \log_a(1-x)$. If $a > 1$, then
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x > 1-x
\end{cases}
$$
which simplifies to
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
x > 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this, we get $0 < x < 1$. If $0 < a < 1$, then
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
1+x < 1-x
\end{cases}
$$
which simplifies to
$$
\begin{cases}
-1 < x < 1 \\
x < 0
\end{cases}
$$
Solving this, we get $-1 < x < 0$. In summary, if $a > 1$, the solution set for the inequality is $(0, 1)$, and if $0 < a < 1$, the solution set for the inequality is $(-1, 0)$.

Therefore, the final answers are:
1. The domain of $f(x) - g(x)$ is $\boxed{(-1, 1)}$.
2. The function $f(x) - g(x)$ is an $\boxed{\text{odd function}}$.
3. The range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ is $\boxed{(0, 1)}$ if $a > 1$, and $\boxed{(-1, 0)}$ if $0 < a < 1$.",[],[],"Step 1: Let's start with the domain. We want to find the values of $x$ for which both $f(x) = \log_a (1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a (1-x)$ are defined. 
For $f(x)$, we require $1+x > 0$, which gives us the domain $x > -1$. For $g(x)$, we need $1-x > 0$, giving us $x < 1$. Therefore, the overlap of their domains is $x \in (-1, 1)$.

Step 2: Next, we'll determine the parity of the function $f(x) - g(x)$. Parity refers to the behavior of the function around odd and even integers. Both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are even functions, because they are of the form $f(x) = h(-x)$ for some function $h$. 
So, $f(x) - g(x)$ is an even function minus an even function, which is an odd function. This means that $f(x) - g(x)$ changes sign around zero.

Step 3: Finally, we need to find the range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$. From the previous step, we know that the function changes from negative to positive as we move away from zero. 
Therefore, we only need to find the zero-crossing point. Setting $f(x) - g(x) = 0$, we get $\log_a(1+x) = \log_a(1-x)$. This simplifies to $1+x = 1-x$, which gives us $x = 0$. 

So, the required range is $x \in (-1, 0)$.

Therefore, the boxed answer is:
$$\boxed{x \in \left(-1, 0\right)}.$$","The candidate solution is incorrect in Step 2 and Step 3. In Step 2, the parity of the function $f(x) - g(x)$ is incorrectly identified as an even function. The correct approach is to consider the symmetry of the domain and analyze the function's behavior around the origin. By showing that $F(x) = -F(-x)$, it can be concluded that $f(x) - g(x)$ is an odd function.

In Step 3, the solution incorrectly assumes that finding the zero-crossing point is sufficient to determine the range where $f(x) - g(x) > 0$. However, the function's behavior depends on the value of $a$. For $a > 1$, the function is increasing on the interval $(-1, 1)$, so $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ for $x \in (0, 1)$. For $0 < a < 1$, the function is decreasing on the interval $(-1, 1)$, so $f(x) - g(x) > 0$ for $x \in (-1, 0)$. The candidate solution fails to consider these cases and provides an incomplete answer.","Step 1: Let's start with the domain. We want to find the values of $x$ for which both $f(x) = \log_a (1+x)$ and $g(x) = \log_a (1-x)$ are defined.

So, $f(x) - g(x)$ is an even function minus an even function, which is an even function. This means that $f(x) - g(x)$ is symmetric about the y-axis."
1,"In $\triangle ABC$, the lengths of the sides opposite to angles $A$, $B$, and $C$ are $a$, $b$, and $c$ respectively. Given that $\cos \frac{C}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}$ and $a \cos B + b \cos A = 2$, find the maximum area of $\triangle ABC$.","Since $\cos \frac{C}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}$, we have $\cos C = 2\cos^2 \frac{C}{2} - 1 = 2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3}\right)^2 - 1 = \frac{1}{9}$.

Using the cosine law, we have $a \cos B + b \cos A = 2$ can be written as

$a \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac} + b \frac{c^2 + b^2 - a^2}{2bc} = 2$

Simplifying the equation, we obtain $c = 2$.

Now, we have $4 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C \geq 2ab - 2ab \frac{1}{9} = \frac{16}{9}ab$, which implies $ab \leq \frac{9}{4}$. The equality holds when $a = b = \frac{3}{2}$.

2,"Given that $P$ is any point on the circle $C$: $(x-2)^{2}+(y-2)^{2}=1$, and $Q$ is any point on the line $l$: $x+y=1$, find the minimum value of $| \overrightarrow{OP}+ \overrightarrow{OQ}|$.","The distance $d$ between the center of the circle $C(2,2)$ and the line $l$: $x+y=1$ is $d= \frac{|2+2-1|}{ \sqrt{2}}= \frac{3}{ \sqrt{2}} > 1$, hence the line $l$ and the circle $C$ are separate.

Let the coordinates of $P$ be $(x,y)$, then $P$ is any point on the circle $C$: $(x-2)^{2}+(y-2)^{2}=1$.

Let the coordinates of $Q$ be $(a,1-a)$, then $Q$ is any point on the line $l$: $x+y=1$.

Thus, $\overrightarrow{OP}+ \overrightarrow{OQ}=(x+a,y+1-a)$, and $| \overrightarrow{OP}+ \overrightarrow{OQ}|= \sqrt{(x+a)^{2}+(y+1-a)^{2}}$, which represents the distance from the point $(-a,a-1)$ to any point on the circle $C$: $(x-2)^{2}+(y-2)^{2}=1$.

Let the distance between the point $(-a,a-1)$ and the center of the circle $C(2,2)$ be $d$, then the minimum value of $| \overrightarrow{OP}+ \overrightarrow{OQ}|$ is $d-1$.

We have $d= \sqrt{(-a-2)^{2}+(a-1-2)^{2}}= \sqrt{2a^{2}-2a+13}= \sqrt{2(a- \frac{1}{2})^{2}+ \frac{25}{2}}$,

When $a= \frac{1}{2}$, $d$ is minimum and equals to $ \sqrt{ \frac{25}{2}}$, hence the minimum value of $| \overrightarrow{OP}+ \overrightarrow{OQ}|$ is $d-1= \frac{5 \sqrt{2}}{2}-1= \boxed{\frac{5 \sqrt{2}-2}{2}}$.

Firstly, determine that the line $l$: $x+y=1$ and the circle $C$ are separate. Then, set the coordinates of $P$ and $Q$ to obtain the coordinates of $\overrightarrow{OP}+ \overrightarrow{OQ}$. The analytical expression of $| \overrightarrow{OP}+ \overrightarrow{OQ}|$ can be derived, and its minimum value can be found using the geometric meaning of $| \overrightarrow{OP}+ \overrightarrow{OQ}|$ and the properties of quadratic functions.
