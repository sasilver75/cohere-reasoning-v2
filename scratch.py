"<answer>-1/4</answer>\n\nStep 1: Let's start by finding the domain of $f(x) - g(x)$. The function $f(x) = \\log_a(1+x)$ is defined for all $x$ such that $1+x > 0$, which gives us $x > -1$. Similarly, $g(x) = \\log_a(1-x)$ is valid for $x < 1$. \n\nThe difference of these functions would keep the overlapping valid range, giving us a domain of **$(f(x) - g(x))': x \\in (-1, 1)$**.\n\nStep 2: To determine the parity, we need to examine the behavior of the function around odd and even integers.\nFor any real number $x$, we have $\\log_a(1+x) - \\log_a(1-x) = \\log_a\\left( \\frac{1+x}{1-x} \\right)$.\n\nLet's denote $y = \\frac{1+x}{1-x}$. Then, around any odd integer $k$, we can find real numbers $x$ such that $y = \\frac{1+x}{1-x} = 1 + \\frac{2k+1}{2}$, or $x = \\frac{2k-1}{3}$. \n\nSimilarly, around even integers, we can find $x$ such that $y = 1 + \\frac{2k}{2}$, or $x = \\frac{2k}{3}$. \n\nWe see that the function changes sign at these integers, implying that it's odd.\n\nStep 3: To find the range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$, we should examine the sign of $\\log_a\\left( \\frac{1+x}{1-x} \\right)$.\n\nNote that $\\log_a\\left( \\frac{1+x}{1-x} \\right) > 0$ is equivalent to $\\frac{1+x}{1-x} > 1$, or $x > \\frac{1 - x}{1 + x}$. This function equals zero at $x = 1/2$, and is positive for $x > 1/2$. Therefore, the range we seek is **$x \\in \\boxed{\\left( \\frac{1}{2}, 1 \\right)}$**."
