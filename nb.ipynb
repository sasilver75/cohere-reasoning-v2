      "The domain of $f(x) = \\log_a(1+x)$ is all the values of $x$ for which $1+x$ is positive, i.e., $x>-1$. Similarly, the domain of $g(x) = \\log_a(1-x)$ is $x<0$.\n",

      "Both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are odd functions, which means that $f(-x) = -f(x)$ and $g(-x) = -g(x)$. This implies that their difference, $f(x) - g(x)$, is even: $f(x) - g(x) = -[f(-x) - g(-x)]$.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step 3: Finally, we need to find the range of $x$ for which $f(x) - g(x) > 0$.\n",

However, when finding the domain of their difference, $f(x) - g(x)$, they state that it is the intersection of these domains, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to consider the composite domain where both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are defined, which is $-1 < x < 1$. This is because for $f(x) - g(x)$ to be defined, both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ must be defined at the same time.\n",

This can be seen by substituting $-x$ into the functions: $f(-x) = \\log_a(1-x) = -\\log_a(1+x) = -f(x)$, but $g(-x) = \\log_a(1+x) \\neq -g(x)$. Therefore, the difference $f(x) - g(x)$ is not necessarily even.\n",

      "Step 3: The candidate solution attempts to rewrite $f(x) - g(x)$ as $\\log_a \\left( \\frac{1+x}{1-x} \\right)$, which is correct. However, the subsequent reasoning is flawed. They state that for this expression to be positive, $\\frac{1+x}{1-x}$ must be greater than zero and greater than 1. This is not accurate, as the expression can be positive for certain values of $a$ even when $\\frac{1+x}{1-x}$ is less than 1. The correct approach is to consider the cases for $a > 1$ and $0 < a < 1$ separately, as shown in the ground-truth solution. \n",
