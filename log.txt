Recap:
Perturbation:
I'm at the point where I seem to have a reliable way to generate weak completions until I have a (strong-verified) incorrect solution.
I'm then able to truncate the bad solution to the point of error.

Completion:
I'm then able to generate a strong completion continued the weak completion prefix.
I then have the ability to use a strong verifier to verify the correctness of the strong completion.

I have a number of scripts that create UIs to view results at various points
audits__ operate on the data produced by Perturbation
completion__ operate on the data produced by Compltion
